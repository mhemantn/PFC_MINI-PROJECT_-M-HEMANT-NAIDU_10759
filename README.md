# 📘 Student Attendance Management System (C)

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a simple **Student Attendance Management System** developed using the **C programming language**.  
It records, displays, and counts student attendance using a **1D array**, where `1` represents Present and `0` represents Absent.

## 🎯 Why This Project
This project was created to understand the practical use of **arrays, loops, and conditional statements** in C by solving a real-world problem.

## ⚙️ Utility
- Records student attendance
- Displays attendance status
- Counts total present and absent students

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C  
- Compiler: GCC  
- Editor: VS Code  

## 📘 What I Learned
- Use of 1D arrays
- Looping and conditional logic
- Writing simple C programs
- Uploading projects to GitHub

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add student names or roll numbers
- Use 2D arrays for multi-day attendance
- Store attendance using files
